### 2021/04/10

Pros:

- Good price (322) but still below 20 moving average.  My guess the price will be stable after 1 week or fall down. Monitor it after one week.

Cons:

- The PEG increase from 1 to 5. That is not good signal. Need verify company growth after next earning

### 2021/04/30

From RSI, ZM should go down this week. 
Pivot point [318.6, 309.2]
